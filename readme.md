## Creating Migrations

1. open `Package Manager Console`

3. set default project to `StripePro`
4. run `add-migration [Migration Name] -o "Common/Data/Migrations"`
5. double check to make sure the migration is correct

1. open `Package Manager Console`
2. setup startup project to `StripePro` 
3. set default project to `StripePro`
4. run `update-database` to update your local database

## Basic Rules

1. Services don't reference other services (to avoid circular dependency)
2. Managers can reference as many services as neeeded, and can reference other managers
3. Repositories are generic but can be customized with extension methods
4. Entity classes shouldn't contain any logic unless it's part of a computed column
5. If entity class needs logic, write an extension method
6. Dtos types: ViewModels, Form, Info, etc
7. 2 types of Dto, Basic, Composite
8. Basic typically dtos don't have constructor, have mapping with automapper
9. Use inheritance with AutoMapper using .IncludeAllDerived() between mappings
10. Composite Dtos get hydrated from other basic dtos.
11. Service methods never return entities
12. Entities and Dtos can coordinate properties with interface (See IProvider)
